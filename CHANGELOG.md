# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).


## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Supporting relative paths in shortlist and sqlite options
- Training and scoring from STDIN
- Support for reading from TSV files from STDIN and other sources during training
  and translation with options --tsv and --tsv-fields n.

### Fixed
- Make mini-batch scaling depend on mini-batch-words and not on mini-batch-words-ref
- In concatenation make sure that we do not multiply 0 with nan (which results in nan)
- Change Approx.epsilon(0.01) to Approx.margin(0.001) in unit tests. Tolerance is now
  absolute and not relative. We assumed incorrectly that epsilon is absolute tolerance.

### Changed
- Python scripts start with #!/usr/bin/env python3 instead of python
- Changed compile flags -Ofast to -O3 and remove --ffinite-math
- Moved old graph groups to depracated folder
- Make cublas and cusparse handle inits lazy to save memory when unused

## [1.6.0] - 2018-08-08

### Added

  ensembles and n-best lists

  attention value greater than the threshold

- Memory-mapping of graphs for inferece with `ExpressionGraph::mmap(const void*
  ptr)` function. (assumes _*.bin_ model is mapped or in buffer)
- Added SRU (--dec-cell sru) and ReLU (--dec-cell relu) cells to inventory of
  RNN cells
- RNN auto-regression layers in transformer (`--transformer-decoder-autreg
  rnn`), work with gru, lstm, tanh, relu, sru cells
- Recurrently stacked layers in transformer (`--transformer-tied-layers 1 1 1 2
  2 2` means 6 layers with 1-3 and 4-6 tied parameters, two groups of
  parameters)
- Seamless training continuation with exponential smoothing

### Fixed
- A couple of bugs in "selection" (transpose, shift, cols, rows) operators
  during back-prob for a very specific case: one of the operators is the first
  operator after a branch, in that case gradient propgation might be
  interrupted. This did not affect any of the existing models as such a case
  was not present, but might have caused future models to not train properly
- Bug in mini-batch-fit, tied embeddings would result in identical embeddings
  in fake source and target batch. Caused under-estimation of memory usage and
  re-allocation
